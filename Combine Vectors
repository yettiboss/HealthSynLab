For each record, combine the vectors generated from different fields to create a unified vector representing that record. This could involve concatenation or averaging.
Example: 
import numpy as np

# Assuming we have embeddings from different fields
text_embedding = np.random.rand(768)  # Example vector from text
category_embedding = np.random.rand(10)  # One-hot or embedding of categorical field
numeric_embedding = np.random.rand(1)  # Numeric feature, normalized

# Concatenate all embeddings into a single vector
final_vector = np.concatenate([text_embedding, category_embedding, numeric_embedding])
