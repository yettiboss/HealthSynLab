These vectors can be stored in a database, indexed for similarity search, or fed into machine learning models.

Example Vectors Based on the Data Model:
Patient Record Vector:
Combination of embeddings from the patient’s demographic information, any notes on encounters, and condition descriptions.

Encounter Record Vector:
A composite of the encounter type, notes, provider’s specialty, and related condition descriptions.

Provider Record Vector:
Embeddings from the provider’s specialty, organization name, and aggregated descriptions from patient encounters.

Condition Record Vector:
Focused on the condition description and possibly embeddings from linked encounters and patient demographics.
