## Overview

This document outlines the key data domains within the unified healthcare data model. Each domain represents a specific area or category of data that is essential for managing healthcare information in a structured and organized way.

## 1. Patient Domain

- **Table**: `patients`
- **Description**: 
  - This domain contains demographic and identifying information about patients. It includes details such as names, dates of birth, gender, contact information, and addresses.

## 2. Encounter Domain

- **Table**: `encounters`
- **Description**: 
  - This domain captures the interactions between patients and healthcare providers. Each record in this domain represents a visit, consultation, procedure, or any other form of healthcare service delivered to the patient.

## 3. Provider Domain

- **Table**: `providers`
- **Description**: 
  - This domain stores information about healthcare professionals and organizations. It includes data such as the provider's name, specialty, license information, and contact details.

## 4. Condition Domain

- **Table**: `conditions`
- **Description**: 
  - The condition domain contains data related to diagnoses or medical conditions associated with a patient's healthcare encounters. It tracks the condition codes (e.g., ICD-10), descriptions, onset, and resolution dates.

## 5. Specialty Domains

These domains store data specific to various healthcare specialties and therapies. Each specialty has its own table that captures relevant details.

### Chiropractic Domain

- **Table**: `chiropractic`
- **Description**: 
  - Contains data related to chiropractic care, such as types of adjustments, outcomes, and associated notes.

### Dental Domain

- **Table**: `dental`
- **Description**: 
  - Stores information on dental procedures, treatments, and follow-ups, including procedure codes and descriptions.

### Vision Domain

- **Table**: `vision`
- **Description**: 
  - Captures data related to vision care, including eye exams, prescriptions, and vision therapies.

### Therapeutic Domain

- **Table**: `therapeutic`
- **Description**: 
  - Manages data on various therapeutic practices, such as physical and occupational therapy, including session counts and outcomes.

## 6. Mapping Domains

These domains manage the interoperability and standardization of the data by mapping internal codes to widely accepted healthcare standards.

### OMOP Mapping Domain

- **Table**: `omop_mappings`
- **Description**: 
  - Maps internal data codes to the OMOP Common Data Model, facilitating research and standardized data analysis.

### US CDI Mapping Domain

- **Table**: `us_cdi_mappings`
- **Description**: 
  - Maps internal codes to the United States Core Data for Interoperability (US CDI) to ensure compliance with national standards.

### OpenHIE Mapping Domain

- **Table**: `openhie_mappings`
- **Description**: 
  - Maps internal codes to Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) standards, supporting global interoperability and data sharing.

This structured approach to data domains helps ensure that each aspect of healthcare data—from patient demographics to specialized treatments and interoperability standards—is properly organized, accessible, and standardized.
